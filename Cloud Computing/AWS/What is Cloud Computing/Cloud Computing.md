#### What is Cloud Computing

- The on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage applications and other IT resources
- Pay as you go pricing - you only pay for what you requested, when you requested it
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
	- You can access as many resources as you need - **instantly**
- Instead of using our own data center, we're going to use the cloud

#### Different kinds of clouds

###### Private Cloud

- Used by a single organisation, not exposed to the public
- You get your own private cloud/data center


###### Public Cloud

- Examples => AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- The cloud resources are owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider and they're delivered over the internet

###### Hybrid Cloud

- Keep some on premise servers and extend some of the capabilities we need into the cloud
	- Have the control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure but have the flexibility and the cost effectiveness of using the public cloud
#### Characteristics of cloud computing

###### On demand self service
- Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider

###### Broad network access
- Resources are available over the network and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
###### Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
- Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
###### Rapid elasticity and scalability
- Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
- Quickly and easily scale based on demand

###### Measured service
- Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

#### The 6 advantages of Cloud computing

###### Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operation expense (OPEX)
- Pay on demand => don't own hardware
- Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) and Operation Expense (OPEX)
	- You don't buy hardware in advance, you're just going to rent it from AWS
###### Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale

###### Stop guessing capacity
- We can now scale based on actual measured usage

###### Increase speed and agility
- Create, operate and do stuff right away

###### Stop spending money running and mainmtaining data centers
###### Go global in minutes

#### Problems solved by the Cloud

- Flexibility => Change resource types when needed
- Cost-effectiveness => Pay as you go, for what you use
- Scalability => Accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- Elasticity => Ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- High-availability and fault tolerance => Build across data centers
