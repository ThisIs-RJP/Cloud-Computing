#### Types of Cloud Computing

###### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- Provide building blocks for cloud IT
- Provides networking, computers, data storage space
- Given a high level of flexibility
- Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
	- Easily understand how we can migrate from traditional on-premise IT to the cloud

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- Removes the need for your organisation to manage the underlying infrastructure
- Focus on the deployment and management of your applications

#### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider


#### Key differences

###### For On-premise

- You have to manage the following
	- Applications
	- Data
	- Runtime
	- Middleware
	- OS
	- Virtualisation
	- Servers
	- Storage Networking

###### For Infrastructure as a Service

- You have to manage the following
	- Applications
	- Data
	- Runtime
	- Middleware
	- OS

- But the following are managed by the service provider
	- Virtualisation
	- Servers
	- Storage 
	- Networking

###### For Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- You manage even less => Cloud service provider manages
	- Runtime
	- Middleware
	- OS
	- Virtualisation
	- Servers
	- Storage
	- Networking

#### For Software as a Service

- Everything is managed by the cloud service provider

#### Example of Cloud Computing Types

###### IaaS

- Amazon EC2
- GCP, Azure, Rackspace etc

###### Platform as a Service

- Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
- Heroku
- Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (MS)

###### Software as a Service
- Many AWS services (e.g Rekognition for Machine Learning)
- Google Apps (Gmail)m Dropbox, Zoom


#### Pricing of the Cloud

###### Compute
- Pay for compute time

###### Storage
- Pay for data stored in the Cloud

###### Data transfer OUT and IN the cloud is free

All of this solves the expensive issue of traditional IT as we only pay for exactly what we need
